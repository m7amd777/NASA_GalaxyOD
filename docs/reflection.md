# 🌟 Reflection

Working on the Galaxy Detection Web App was both fun and educational.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **Flask Basics:**  
  I deepened my understanding of how Flask works — from setting up routes to handling file uploads and serving static content.

- **Using API Keys:**  
  I learned how to securely integrate and use API keys with external services like Roboflow, which made interacting with computer vision models really seamless and interesting.

- **Practical Application of APIs:**  
  It was satisfying to see how easy it can be to leverage powerful models through an API and build something interactive on top of it.

- **Revisiting GitHub Concepts:**  
  I got the chance to catch up on some Git and GitHub practices, such as writing a proper `README.md`, structuring a project repo, and thinking about version control more intentionally.

## 🔁 Overall

This was a great refresher project that helped me put together several skills I’ve picked up over time — and wrap it all up in something cool and space-themed!
