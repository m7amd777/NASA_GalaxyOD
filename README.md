# ðŸŒŒ Galaxy Detection Web App

This is a simple Flask-based web application that automatically detects galaxies in an uploaded image using a computer vision model via the Roboflow API.

Just upload an image of space, and the app will return the image with detected galaxies annotated â€” all within seconds!

This type of technology is implemented in many modern telescopes used in space exploration.

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure the following are set up:

### âœ… Python
Ensure Python 3.7 or later is installed.

To check:
```bash
python --version
```

### âœ… Roboflow Account & API Key
- Sign up at [https://app.roboflow.com](https://app.roboflow.com)
- Create a project (e.g., Galaxy Detection)
- Get your **API key** from your Roboflow dashboard, for the assignment API KEY is attached to save time

### âœ… Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Set up a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install flask supervision opencv-python os inference_sdk
```

---

## ðŸš€ Running the App

1. Place your Roboflow API key inside `app.py` where indicated.
2. Run the Flask app:
```bash
python app.py
```
3. Open your browser and go to the port that shows in the terminal for you, example:  
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. Upload an image through the web interface.
2. The image is sent to Roboflowâ€™s API for prediction.
3. The app downloads the annotated image and displays it back to you.
